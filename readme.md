# king-of-sniper-ammo

This repository includes a very small website used for advertising the 
"King of Sniper Ammo" brand. This brand exists only within an online video game - 
Terry Johnson, and the goods he is offering to sell in these pages, is fictional.
The webpages were developed solely to give me an advantage in selling the goods 
in the video game.

The online game offers an extensive player-led economy where I have to convice 
other players to spend their virtual cash in order to sell the goods. Therefore 
I created this site to convice them to buy it.
